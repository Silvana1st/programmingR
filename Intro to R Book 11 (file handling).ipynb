    "This tells us several things. The first letter <code>C</code> is the hard drive the file is stored on (C is the default drive on a Windows machine). Then we have a number of folders separated by slashes. On some operating systems the slashes may be the other way around. In this example, on the hard drive <code>C</code>, there is a folder called <code>Users</code>, within this, another folder called <code>Alan_Davies</code>, then a folder called <code>NLP</code> which contains the file <code>alan.PNG</code>. The other point to note is the letters that come after the dot (period) in a file name. This is referred to as the <code>file extension</code> and determines what type of file it is. In this case it's an image, specifically a Portable Network Graphic (PNG). You may be familiar with other types of file such as a word document <code>.docx</code> or a Portable Document Format (PDF) file <code>.pdf</code> and so on. This example is depicted graphically below."

    "Let's try to open a file. Here we will create a variable that stores the path and filename of the required file. This file is a text file (<code>*.txt</code>) and contains the lyrics for the Nirvana song \"Something in way\", which is also the name of the file. The <code>./</code> is for a <code>relative</code> path (relative to this notebook). This means the folder can be accessed if we put the notebook in different places as long as there is a folder called <code>file_handling</code> in the same folder the notebook is in. This saves us having to hard code the specific path. For example when I wrote this notebook, the file was here: <code>C:\\Users\\Alan_Davies\\Intro to programming (Python)\\file_handling\\Something in the way.txt</code>. I send these notebooks to someone who uploads them onto a server. The path could be quite different in this case. It might for example be: <code>E:\\data_files\\teaching\\FBMH\\SHS\\intro_programming\\file_handling\\Something in the way.txt</code>. This is where the power of relative paths comes in. As long as the folder <code>file_handling</code> is relative to this notebook file, we don't have to explicitly add the full file path to work with the file. "
