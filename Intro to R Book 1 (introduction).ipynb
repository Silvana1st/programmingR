    "Learning to code is an emotional journey. There will be ups and downs. It is also important that you have realistic expectations. I will share two analogies with you to give some context. Learning to code is like learning to play an instrument like the guitar. We can show you what a guitar looks like, what notes the strings represent and teach you a few chords. By the end you could play a few simple tunes. You will certainly not be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix\" target=\"_blank\">Jimi Hendrix</a>. You would need to spend a lot of time practicing and developing these skills in your own time outside of lessons. Another analogy is something like carpentry. We can show you the tool kit (hammer, saw, plane etc.), we can explain how the tools work and show you with examples some of the things you can do with those tools. But again we can't show you all the possible combinations of things you could make with them. This is something you will experience over time and by working on different projects. Programming is as much an art as it is a science. "
